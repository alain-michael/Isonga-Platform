### **Page Change to make**

---

### **Login Page**

1. Add Social/SSO Options: Include buttons for login via Google, LinkedIn, or email-based SSO to speed up access for business users.
2. Password Recovery Integration: Add a "Forgot Password?" link directly below the password field, leading to a secure reset flow with email/SMS verification.
3. Multilingual Toggle: Place a language selector (e.g., English, French, Swahili) at the top-right, as discussed for broader accessibility in diverse markets.
4. Error Handling: Implement real-time validation (e.g., red outlines for invalid username/password) and friendly error messages like "Invalid credentials—try again or reset password."
5. Adding a "Register" button near the "Sign In" button on the login page could enhance user accessibility by providing a clear, immediate option for new users to create an account without navigating elsewhere.

### **Registration Pages**

1. Unify Variants: There are two registration screens—one with First/Last Name, Username, Email, Phone; another with Email, Phone, Password. Standardize into a single, progressive form: Start with basic user info, then business details, to avoid overwhelming users. Use conditional fields (e.g., show Username only if needed).
2. Field Enhancements: Add auto-complete for phone numbers with country codes and email validation to prevent typos. For passwords, include strength indicators and requirements (e.g., 8+ characters, mix of letters/numbers).
3. Privacy Notice: Include a checkbox for agreeing to terms/privacy policy, linking to a GDPR-compliant policy page.
4. Progress Indicator: Add a stepper (e.g., 1/3: User Info > 2/3: Business Basics > 3/3: Confirmation).

*Additional note:* Use conditional logic to reveal KYC fields only after core registration fields are completed.
